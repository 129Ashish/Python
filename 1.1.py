print("In Python, a STATEMENT is an executable instruction that performs some action, such as assigning a value, printing output, or controlling the flow of a program. Statements are executed by the interpreter and do not return a value.---On the other hand, an EXPRESSION is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a value. Expressions are used to compute a result, which can be used as input to another expression, assignment, or statement.")
